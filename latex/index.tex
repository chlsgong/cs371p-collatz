This is a program involving the calculation of the Collatz Conjecture.

The rules are simple\-:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If the number is even, divide by 2.
\item If the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The problem is finding the max cycle length of a range of numbers, i to j. The solution in the program uses a lazy cache to store calculations of all requested numbers. Although inefficient, it was easy to implement.
